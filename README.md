# Cycle-Hunt

The software in this repository simulates a scavenger hunt were two teams start at opposing positions in a country. The goal of one team is it to reach a specific destination while the other team tries to catch it. 

In this version the simulation is incomplete, so that only a few functions are already implemented. 

## Implemented functions 
- Set the Bicycle position of the Team
- Set a waypoint to which the team is driving
- Set the velocity of the Team
- Let the team drive towards the waypoint

## Upcoming functions
- Server that handles the game mechanics and allows two teams
- Display camping spots where the teams have to arrive during the night
- Make the velocity dependent on the incline of the terrain
- Add a day and night cycle
- Add a destination that one team has to reach
- Add criteria when the game ends and one team wins
